# Exercise 1
# 10/10 points (graded)

# For the following problem, consider the following way to write a power set generator. The number of possible combinations to put n
# items into one bag is 2n. Here, items is a Python list. If need be, also check out the docs on bitwise operators (<<, >>, &, |, ~, ^).

# generate all combinations of N items
# def powerSet(items):
#     N = len(items)
#     # enumerate the 2**N possible combinations
#     for i in range(2**N):
#         combo = []
#         for j in range(N):
#             # test bit jth of integer i
#             if (i >> j) % 2 == 1:
#                 combo.append(items[j])
#         yield combo
# As above, suppose we have a generator that returns every combination of objects in one bag. We can represent this as a list of 1s
# and 0s denoting whether each item is in the bag or not.

# Write a generator that returns every arrangement of items such that each is in one or none of two different bags. Each combination
# should be given as a tuple of two lists, the first being the items in bag1, and the second being the items in bag2.

# def yieldAllCombos(items):
#     """
#       Generates all combinations of N items into two bags, whereby each
#       item is in one or zero bags.
#
#       Yields a tuple, (bag1, bag2), where each bag is represented as
#       a list of which item(s) are in each bag.
#     """
# Note this generator should be pretty similar to the powerSet generator above.

# We mentioned that the number of possible combinations for N items into one bag is 2n. How many possible combinations exist when
# there are two bags? Think about this for a few minutes, then click the following hint to confirm if your guess is correct.
# Remember that a given item can only be in bag1, bag2, or neither bag -- it is not possible for an item to be present in both bags!

# How many possible combinations exist for N items into two bags?
