# Problem 3: StandardRobot Class

# Problem 3: StandardRobot Class
# 10.0/10.0 points (graded)
# Each robot must also have some code that tells it how to move about a room, which will go in a method called updatePositionAndClean.

# Ordinarily we would consider putting all the robot's methods in a single class. However, later in this problem set we'll consider
# robots with alternate movement strategies, to be implemented as different classes with the same interface. These classes will have a
# different implementation of updatePositionAndClean but are for the most part the same as the original robots. Therefore, we'd like to
# use inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicated code.

# We have already refactored the robot code for you into two classes: the Robot class you completed in Problem 2 (which contains general
# robot code), and a StandardRobot class that inherits from it (which contains its own movement strategy).

# Complete the updatePositionAndClean method of StandardRobot to simulate the motion of the robot after a single time-step (as described
# on the Simulation Overview page).

# class StandardRobot(Robot):
#     """
#     A StandardRobot is a Robot with the standard movement strategy.

#     At each time-step, a StandardRobot attempts to move in its current direction; when
#     it hits a wall, it chooses a new direction randomly.

# We have provided the getNewPosition method of Position, which you may find helpful:

# class Position(object):

#     def getNewPosition(self, angle, speed):
#        """
#        Computes and returns the new Position after a single clock-tick has
#        passed, with this object as the current position, and with the
#        specified angle and speed.

#        Does NOT test whether the returned position fits inside the room.

#        angle: number representing angle in degrees, 0 <= angle < 360

# Note: You can pass in an integer or a float for the angle parameter.

# Before moving on to Problem 4, check that your implementation of StandardRobot works by uncommenting the following line under your
# implementation of StandardRobot. Make sure that as your robot moves around the room, the tiles it traverses switch colors from gray to
# white. It should take about a minute for it to clean all the tiles.
