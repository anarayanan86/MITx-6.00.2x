# Problem 1: RectangularRoom Class

# Problem 1: RectangularRoom Class
# 10.0/10.0 points (graded)
# You will need to design two classes to keep track of which parts of the room have been cleaned as well as the position and direction of
# each robot.

# In ps2.py, we've provided skeletons for the following two classes, which you will fill in in Problem 1:
# RectangularRoom: Represents the space to be cleaned and keeps track of which tiles have been cleaned.
# Position: We've also provided a complete implementation of this class. It stores the x- and y-coordinates of a robot in a room.
# Read ps2.py carefully before starting, so that you understand the provided code and its capabilities.

# Problem 1
# In this problem you will implement the RectangularRoom class. For this class, decide what fields you will use and decide how the
# following operations are to be performed:
# Initializing the object
# Marking an appropriate tile as cleaned when a robot moves to a given position (casting floats to ints - and/or the function math.floor
# - may be useful to you here)
# Determining if a given tile has been cleaned
# Determining how many tiles there are in the room
# Determining how many cleaned tiles there are in the room
# Getting a random position in the room
# Determining if a given position is in the room
# Complete the RectangularRoom class by implementing its methods in ps2.py.

# Although this problem has many parts, it should not take long once you have chosen how you wish to represent your data. For reasonable
# representations, a majority of the methods will require only a couple of lines of code.)

# Hint: During debugging, you might want to use random.seed(0) so that your results are reproducible.

# Enter your code for RectangularRoom below.
